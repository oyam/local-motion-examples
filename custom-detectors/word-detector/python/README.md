# Word Detector using Google Cloud Vision API

![default-detector-demo](../../../assets/custom-word-detector-demo.gif)

In this example, [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs) is used to detect words for custom detector of [Local Motion](https://github.com/oyam/local-motion).

### Prerequisite

- Install Docker and Docker-compose
- Prepare service account key to use Google Cloud Vision API. As shown in docker-compose.yml, it is assumed that the service account key exists in the `secrets` folder and the name should be `vision-api-service-account-key.json`. For information about service account key, please refer to [official document](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/setup#sa).

### Usage

1. Run Web API in local environment by following commands

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
2. In the settings of Local Motion, choose custom detector and set URL as `http://localhost:8100/word-detection`
3. Choose Motion Box Positions in settings of Local Motion. Setting positions as middle-left, middle-right, or both of them corresponds to motion of first, last, and first/last letters of word respectively. As examples of Motion settings, "Initial Letter Motion" is shown below.
