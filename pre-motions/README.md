# Pre-motions

Local motion is supposed to be triggered by a shortcut after moving the mouse cursor in some way. Therefore, it is desirable for the pre-motion to meet one or both of the following:
- Move mouse cursor to around the target position. Coordinate errors after movement can be tolerated up to the window size set in Local Motion.
- Press shortcut to invoke Local Motion

### List of Examples
- Talon: Move mouse cursor to the gaze position by Talon with Tobii Eye Traker 5, and invoke Local Motion by scripts in this example.
